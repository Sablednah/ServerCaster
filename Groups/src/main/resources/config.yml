# When Using groups make a extra layer
# you will get something like:
# Messages:
# Group1:
# - 'message for Group1'
# Group2:
# - 'message for Group2'

# Permissions without groups looks like ServerCaster.Messages
# With groups they look like - ServerCaster.Messages.Group1
# When using inherenting groups make sure you remove the person from the previous group
# You can do this by adding - -ServerCaster.Messages.Group1 to the desired group
