# To use this plugin you need to give players the right permission inside the groups!
# Personal permissions will not work!

# Currently the only groups plugin supported is: GroupManager (by Essentials)
# The permission for GroupManger is ServerCaster.Messages.{group name}
# Where {group name} is the name of the group listed below here.
# Capitals matter!!!!!!
